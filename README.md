# OpenSeeFaceSample

This is a sample Unity project set up for [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace) 1.20.0. Open the included scene from the Scenes folder.

If you are running this on Windows, you can import OVR Lip Sync 1.28 and uncomment the first three lines of the OpenSeeVRMDriver.cs component and add the basic OVR lip sync component to the scene. You can also add an OpenSeeLauncher on the OpenSee object and enter the necessary paths to launch the tracking automatically.

For hand tracking, see here: https://gist.github.com/emilianavt/b211073096a4484fb92e6550212c2f48
